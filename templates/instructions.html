        <strong>Initial Analysis:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Examine the provided retinal image (1ST Image) carefully.</li>
          <li>Assign a Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) severity rating based on your expert analysis.</li>
          <li>Select the appropriate DR rating from the drop-down menu.</li>
          <li>Submit your rating by clicking 'Submit Rating'.</li>

        <strong>Grad-CAM Visualization and Model Prediction Review:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>After submission, you will see the AI model's prediction along with a heat map overlay (2ND Image).</li>
          <li>The heat map, generated by Grad-CAM, highlights the areas in the image that most influenced the AI's prediction, providing insight into its decision-making process.</li>
          <li>Review the highlighted areas and compare them against the AI's prediction and your initial analysis.</li>
          <li>Evaluate the alignment of the model's focus areas with the pathological features you identify as relevant.</li>
          <li>Select an accuracy score for the visual diagnosis and disease severity from the drop-down menus.</li>
          <li>Provide your feedback on the AI's visual interpretation and severity assessment by clicking 'Submit Feedback'.</li>
        </ul>
